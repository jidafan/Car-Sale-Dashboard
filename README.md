### Introduction

There is a lot of information that needs to be stored after a company makes a sale, this includes the price of the sale, the product sold, the location of the purchase and much more. The dashboard tracks information on vehicle sales made by a company from all over the US. The dashboard contains a detailed view of the orders, sales and customers. 

### Data Review

The information in the datasets contains information on 1000 car sales from a fictitious company. The data was sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prashantk93/supply-chain-management-for-car/data) and downloaded using the Kaggle API. The code for downloading the data can be accessed [here](https://github.com/jidafan/Car-Sale-Dashboard/blob/main/Download.ipynb).
